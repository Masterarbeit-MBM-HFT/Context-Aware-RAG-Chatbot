# Context-Aware PDF Question Answering with LLMs

This project is a context-aware question answering system built on top of large language models (LLMs). It allows users to upload PDF documents and then ask natural language questions about the documentâ€™s content. The system uses advanced embedding and retrieval techniques to provide accurate, contextually relevant answers.

## Key Features:

Upload PDF documents for analysis

Ask questions in natural language about the uploaded content

Dynamic display of the LLM model used for answering

Responsive React frontend styled with Material-UI

Flask backend API serving health checks, file upload, and question answering endpoints

Dockerized setup for easy development and deployment

## How to run ?

```bash
$ cd compose
$ docker-compose up --build
```

* Check on `http://localhost:3000/` for React frontend
* Check on `http://localhost:5000/api/health` for Flask backend
